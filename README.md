Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who loves to create and share useful tools and resources for developers. I have experience in web development, data science, machine learning, and natural language processing. I'm also passionate about open source and contributing to the community.

Some of the projects I'm currently working on are:

- [Awesome AI](https://github.com/awesome-ai/awesome-ai): A curated list of awesome AI resources, frameworks, libraries, courses, books, and more.
- [Code Snippets](https://github.com/code-snippets/code-snippets): A collection of code snippets for various languages and frameworks that can help you save time and write better code.
- [Bing Chat](https://github.com/bing-chat/bing-chat): A chatbot that uses Bing search engine to answer questions, generate content, and provide suggestions.

You can find more of my projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/my-profile) or on my [personal website](https://my-website.com).

I'm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and learning new things. Feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:my-email@example.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/my-twitter), or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/my-linkedin).
